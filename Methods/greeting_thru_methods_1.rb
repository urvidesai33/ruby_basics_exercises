#Write two methods, one that returns the string "Hello" and one that returns the string "World". Then print both strings using #puts, combining them into one sentence.

#Expected output:

#Hello World

def say_hello
  "Hello"
end

def say_world
  "World"
end


puts say_hello + " " + say_world #string concatenation
